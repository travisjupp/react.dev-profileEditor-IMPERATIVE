# react.dev-profileEditor-IMPERATIVE

Created with CodeSandbox

Imagine React didn’t exist. Can you refactor this code in a way that makes the logic less fragile and more similar to the React version? What would it look like if the state was explicit, like in React?

If you’re struggling to think where to start, the stub below already has most of the structure in place. If you start here, fill in the missing logic in the updateDOM function. (Refer to the original code where needed.)
